	// Place your snippets for typescript here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"Describe Test Suite": {
		"prefix": "tdescribe",
		"body": [
			"describe('$1', () => {});"
		],
		"description": "Test description"
	},
	"Individual Test Case": {
		"prefix": "tit",
		"body": [
			"it('should $1', () => {});"
		],
		"description": "Unit test"
	}
